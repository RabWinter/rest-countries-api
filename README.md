## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I gained good experience in retrieving and displaying data from a large API. In particular, in order to access the full names of the border countries I had to make another API call specifically for the country alpha codes and tie these in the with country names. Border country names were not given in the data base, only the alpha codes.

On reflection, although the site works I am currently rebuilding this project using REACT. This will be my first real venture with the framework and I feel it will allow me to write more modular, reuseable code.
